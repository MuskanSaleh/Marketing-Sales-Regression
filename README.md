# Marketing-Sales-Regression
A linear regression analysis on marketing sales data, exploring the impact of radio promotion budgets on sales. Implemented Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and checked model assumptions, including linearity, normality, independent observations, and homoscedasticity. Visualizations are included to support insights and findings.

***Project Findings:***

Model Summary: Simple Linear Regression on marketing sales data.

Y-intercept: 41.5326, Slope: 8.1733.

Interpretation: A $1 million increase in radio promotion budget leads to an average sales increase of $8.1733 million.

Statistical Significance: p-value = 0.000 (significant at 0.05 level).

Hypothesis Testing: Reject the null hypothesis (no relationship between radio budget and sales).

Confidence Interval: 95% CI for the slope: [7.791, 8.555], meaning the true slope likely falls in this range.
